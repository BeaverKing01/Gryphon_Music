In high school he tought a penny whistle class, he also went on to play clarinet and trumpet in the Plumstead High School wind band. At the age of 15 he started playing bass, and at 16 he was given his first guitar.</p><br />
          <br />
          <p>After High School he started work at Paul Bothner Music and he worked as a guitar specialist and guitar tech. It was during this time that he started teaching. Part time at first, and then olpening the school in 2007.</p><br />
          <br />
          <p>For the first few years he played classical guitar. He started to get bored with classical and ventured in blues and rock, and is currently playing in "Sorry Mr Devil", an acoustic blues duet.</p>

                <h3>Chad Browne</h3>
                <br />
                <p>Chad started music young   with piano at the age of 10, sadly it never really stuck and didn't progress too far until he discovered guitar at the age of 14, which he   didn't really take seriously until the age of 16 upon receiving his   first electric guitar and hearing Joe Satriani for the first time.</p>
                <br />
                
                <p>After this period he did a brief stint learning classical, but   soon shifted focus to the styles of music his heros played, namely rock   oriented shred guitar, as the years went on his tastes became more   eclectic, likewise with the styles being incorporated into his playing,   affording him much versatility, this versatility has gotten him a few   lucky breaks including playing in a run of the successful theatre show   &quot;Rock Evolution&quot; and also acting as a hired gun for a local pop act   which afforded him the opportunity to play at the KKNK and a morning   appearance on national T.V with the Expresso show. Chad is currently   active as the guitarist in the progressive metal band Zero Stroke, and   online creating ambient theme music under the handle GrimShark.</p>
